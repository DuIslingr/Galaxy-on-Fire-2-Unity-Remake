// NetFactions.cs
// Remake-only: factions, the lasting player groups of a dedicated server with profiles (NetProfiles). A squad (NetSquad)
// stays the session's quick group for flying together (shared missions, no friendly fire); a faction is kept between
// sessions by profile and is what will hold territory (home station, claims, bank: later phases).
//   A faction: a name (MaxNameLength), a tag of 2-4 letters / digits shown before its members' names ("[TAG] Name": the
//     lock plate, chat), a leader, officers and members (profile ids), a bank (credits, for the later phases) and a home
//     station (-1 = none yet).
//   Chat commands (answered to the sender only): /faction create TAG Name, /faction invite <pilot>, /faction join TAG,
//     /faction leave, /faction kick <pilot>, /faction promote / demote <pilot>, /faction leader <pilot>, /faction disband,
//     /faction info [TAG], /faction list; "/f <text>" talks to the faction members online.
//   Ranks: the leader does everything; officers invite and kick members; members talk. The leader leaves only by
//     handing over (/faction leader) or as the last member (the faction ends).
//   Storage: factions.json beside the profiles (NetProfiles.Folder), written like them (through .tmp, the old one as .bak).
//   A profile deleted (the console, a /link that replaces it) leaves its faction; a leaderless faction passes to its first
//   officer, else its first member.
// Phase 2, territory:
//   Bank: "/faction deposit N" takes N credits from the player (ChargeRpc: their game pays if it can and answers) into the
//     bank; "/faction withdraw N" (officers) pays N out to the player (GrantRpc). Both move the profile's worth with them
//     (NetProfiles.AdjustWorth), so the upload check neither trips on a withdrawal nor lets a deposit that wasn't paid
//     go unnoticed for long (the client still runs its credits: a modified game can lie about paying).
//   Claims: "/faction claim" (officers, docked at the station) claims it for ClaimCost from the bank, at most MaxClaims per
//     faction; not the Kaamo Club (108) or Loma (system 25). The first claim is the home; "/faction home" (officers, docked at
//     another claim) moves it; "/faction unclaim" (officers, docked there) gives it up. A claim no member has docked at for
//     LapseDays lapses. The claims reach every player (NetState.Claims: "station|TAG|Name|VAT" lines; NetFactionsClient), who
//     see the owner on the star map, the station's header and the orbit information.
//   Home: a member signing in starts docked at the faction's home, and a destroyed member respawns there.
// Phase 3, contest and benefits:
//   Siege: "/faction siege" (officers of another faction, in the orbit or docked there; SiegeCost from the bank as the
//     stake; one at a time; the faction needs room for another claim; not within ProtectionHours of the station's last
//     siege; not the defenders' home while they hold another station) is announced and armed SiegeDelaySeconds later.
//     Armed, it waits until pilots of both factions are alive in the orbit's space at once (real players only: NPCs never
//     start it). Meanwhile:
//       the station defenders escalate (NetOrbit.UpdateSiegeDefenders): DefenderCount / DefenderLevel by the
//         DefenderStepSeconds steps since the arming, frozen when the fight starts;
//       the claim drains: a defending pilot docking there (not a respawn after dying in the fight) halves its remaining
//         lapse days (rounded up) while more than LapseFloorDays are left, never resets it (HalveLapse); a claim lapsing
//         now goes to the attacker (the stake back);
//       the standoff clock: a side present while the other side has a pilot online elsewhere adds to the absent side's
//         standoff; StandoffSeconds of it = that side forfeits;
//       no fight by expiresAt (SiegeMeetSeconds from the arming) = one more day, at most MaxExtensions times, then it ends
//         with no fight: the defenders keep it and win the stake.
//     The fight (SiegeSeconds): the two factions' pilots may fire at each other there (NetFactionsClient.SiegePvp,
//     NetPlayer.PvpWith); every pilot of a side destroyed in the orbit scores for the other side (attKills / defKills); a
//     destroyed defender respawns docked at that station (NetFactionsClient.DefendsSiegeHere in FlightHud). A side whose
//     last pilot there left alive (docked, jumped, disconnected) and stays gone SiegeForfeitSeconds waves the white flag
//     and loses. At the end more kills wins; a tie = held. The stake goes to the winner. Called off, the stake back to the
//     attacker: the claim given up or the defenders disbanding. A fought or finished siege leaves the station protected for
//     ProtectionHours. A claim that lapses without a siege can't be claimed again for LapsedLockSeconds.
//     NetState.Sieges carries them to the players (the HUD banner, TerritoryView). "/faction sieges" lists them.
//   Defence: in a held station's orbit its own race's NPC fighters treat the holder's members as friends and the
//     members of other factions as enemies, unless that pilot paid the toll (Toll credits, asked on arrival by
//     TerritoryView; NetPlayer.TollStation) for this visit. Pilots without a faction are treated as always.
//   Trade cut: at a held station members buy items MemberDiscountPercent cheaper and pay no VAT.
//   VAT: each claim has the holder's rate (Claim.vat, 0..MaxVat %, "/faction vat <rate> [station]", officers; DefaultVat for
//     a new claim). Everyone else (other factions and pilots without one) buys items and dealer ships at the list price plus
//     a tenth of the rate (VatMarkup: 20 % -> +2 %); the rate's share of what they paid goes to the holder's bank
//     (OnPurchase from the shared stock's trades, OnShipBought from the dealer's). Selling there pays no VAT. Units players
//     sold into a station's stock carry no VAT when bought back (NetStock's resale count, cleared when the stock is rolled
//     again), so a buy-and-sell loop doesn't mint money. A higher rate thins the station's goods: each stock roll keeps
//     (100 - rate) % of every row and of the dealer ships (NetStock.Make).
//   Garrison (players' request: a station whose holders are offline fell to one attacker in 5 minutes): officers set a
//     claim's garrison, "/faction garrison <ships> <level> [station]" or the Faction tab: 0..MaxGarrison fighters of the
//     system's race at level 1..MaxGarrisonLevel (hull x(1 + 0.5 (level - 1)), gun x(1 + 0.25 (level - 1)), the dearer
//     fighters from level 3). Upkeep GarrisonUpkeep x ships x level a day from the bank, the first day when it is set
//     (not while the station's siege runs); a bank that can't pay disbands it. In an armed siege the server counts the
//     garrison (Siege.garrisonAlive); the orbit's authority flies that many (NetOrbit.UpdateGarrison: hostile to the attackers, friends of the holders, swarming in
//     front of the station) and reports each death (NetState.GarrisonKillRpc, OnGarrisonKill); a dead fighter comes back
//     GarrisonRespawnSeconds later. Siege.garrisonAlive / level go out with the sieges (PublishSieges).
