// PointDefense.cs
// Remake, for mods (EVERSPACE 2's Missile Defense System; the original has no point defense): equipment with the stat
// "missileDefense" (attr 131, a reach in game units) lets the ship's auto turrets shoot down the homing missiles flying at
// it. While one is within the reach, an auto turret (PlayerTurret) turns to it instead of its ship target, leading it by
// the turret's shot's travel time, and fires when aligned; each shot fired at a missile destroys it when the shot arrives
// (that travel time later), with the rocket impact's burst (GunRig.ShowImpact's SET_EXPLOSION_MANUALLY_BIG). A missile is
// claimed by one shot only, so several turrets spread over a salvo. The missiles are the ones IncomingMissiles reports:
// those homing on the local player that still hold their lock. Multiplayer: another game's missile drawn here (Gun.Mirror)
// is left alone: its real copy flies in the shooter's game, which applies its hit.
// Modified (review of #168): a claim holds the missile's age when it was made, so a new missile fired from the same bullet
// slot before the claim ran out is a missile of its own (neither skipped by Pick nor shot down by the old claim); the claims
// go with the scene (SceneManager.sceneUnloaded), so no burst from a level left behind comes up in the next one.
