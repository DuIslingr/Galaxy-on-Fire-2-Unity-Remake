// LevelScript / process; Reference/research/campaign_levels_a.md 3.17-3.19, campaign_levels_b.md parts 1-2). Plain C#, run
// by CampaignLevel. Ships are Level+0xf8 slots in the original's order (the radio triggers and objectives index them); the
// script step is the level-script event (radio trigger 27).
//   48 B'akrram     chauffeured in Taret Orskk's H'Soc: 5 friendly H'Soc, the player at (0, 0, 55000) on the autopilot to
//                   the station, the stick ignored (MGame::OnUpdate)
//   49 B'akrram     the stolen K'Suukk: the same 5 H'Soc; done 10 s after launch (type 0x9c)
//   50 Makke S'ik   4 H'Soc; once line 2 is over they turn (always-enemy, turnEnemy) and the Terran/Vossk axis goes to
//                   +100 (Standing::setStanding(0, 100))
//   51 S'inokk      a Vossk freighter a third of the way from the gate to the player, 5 H'Soc looping on the gate
//   52 elsewhere    two Vossk freighters halfway from the gate, 6 H'Soc (hull 270 for 49-52 and 56, freighters x5)
//   56 Scion        the turret test in the S'Kanarr: 3 pirate escorts (Velasco, unkillable) that hold fire until the
//                   player's armor is gone, 6 sleeping pirates at the first two waypoints
//   63 Coromesk     the pirate outpost and 6 sleeping pirates; won with fewer than 4 left; the pirates then stop shooting
//   64 Nosdron      Khador (Typhon) flying (100000, 0, 0) with 8 pirates; a cutscene on him, he sits still until 5 are dead,
//                   then the rest flee; won when the last line is over (Khador dead fails)
//   65 Kothar       straight in from 64: the player at (0, 0, 170000), Khador beside him flying to the station
//   67 Nosdron      Corny's break-in: the friendly outpost far out, pirates asleep around it, Corny waits, goes in, comes
//                   out and leaves (fail: the outpost destroyed, until he is out)
//   69 Inari Onu    Trot Lykkt (Type 43) leaves toward 4 x the second planet; a cutscene, then he is gone
//   70 Lopat        Trot Lykkt between the player (120000 further back) and the station: the Disruptor Laser (x2.5), his
//                   hull x2.5 then x3, speed 10; won when he is dead
//   73 Teres        the "weapons" convoy: 4 Terran freighters, 8 pirates (4 of them later); EMP a freighter to stop the
//                   convoy; won with all pirates dead, failed with all freighters dead
//   78 Valkyrie     the escape: the battlestation's turrets slide out, the hyper drive, the station jumps away, 20 pirates
//                   come in (the Khador Drive then misjumps into the Void, SystemJump)
//   79 the Void     7 Void fighters (done at once: type 0xa5)
//   80 Kothar       Alice's battlestation (0, 0, 160000) with 8 turrets and 4 shield generators, pirates, 3 friendly Wards;
//                   its laser blows up part of the station; all of them dead -> the battlestation jumps away
//   81 the Void     Alice stranded: the battlestation drops out of hyperspace, her lines, fade out, docked at Kothar
// Remake picks for floats the decompile lost (campaign_levels_b.md "uncertain"): the cutscene camera y drift of 80 (0),
// the step-11 explosion and the step-12 hyper drive of 80 at the battlestation, the look-at point of 81 (the origin), the
// Void fighters of 79 / 81 around the orbit like the other Void orbits.
