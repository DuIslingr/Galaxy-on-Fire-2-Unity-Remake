// GraphQuestState.cs
// Remake: what a save keeps of a single-player event graph run that lasts (Session.GraphQuests): a quest (the graph's
// Start node kind Quest, like a story chain) or a bar mission taken in a Space Lounge. EventRunner writes it when the run
// starts and at each checkpoint (the variables, objective, target and quiet orbits as they were there); loading a save
// starts the run again from that checkpoint (EventRunner.RestoreLocal). Plain data for JsonUtility.
