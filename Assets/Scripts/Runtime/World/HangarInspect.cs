// HangarInspect.cs
// Remake-only: the hangar's "Inspect ship". The camera leaves its drifting hangar spot (StationLevel.UpdateCamera), zooms in
// on the player's ship and orbits it like the flight's Action Freeze (UI.PhotoMode): yaw / pitch around the ship's centre
// (the bounds of its meshes), a distance between just outside the hull and a few times its size. The orbit starts where the
// hangar camera is, so the way in is a zoom and a turn toward the ship (BlendMs, the distance easing to FocusRadii x the
// radius); leaving blends back to the hangar camera the same way. The pitch keeps the camera above the hangar floor (the
// hull's lowest point, the pad). Input comes from UI.StationMenu (drag, wheel, pinch, keys, sticks, triggers). Plain C#.
