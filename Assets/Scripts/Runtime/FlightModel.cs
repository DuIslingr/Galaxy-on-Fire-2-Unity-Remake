// FlightModel.cs
// Clean re-implementation of the Galaxy on Fire 2 (Android 2.0.16) player flight behaviour,
// written from notes on the decompiled PlayerEgo / Ship / TargetFollowCamera code.
// Pure C# (only uses UnityEngine math types), so it can be unit-tested outside a scene.
//
// Units: the original works in milliseconds and "GoF units". This class keeps those units
// internally so every constant matches the original; the MonoBehaviour converts to Unity.
//
// Remake: a second flight style, free flight (Settings.FlightStyle, StepFree), after EVERSPACE 2 (not from its code): its
// numbers are measured from recordings of the game and read from its asset values (Reference/research/
// es2_flight_measurements.md). Thrust, strafe and up / down held instead of a throttle, the turn rates ramped toward the
// stick or the mouse's virtual joystick, a manual roll and no auto-level, a held boost on an energy pool, and inertial
// dampeners (on: each axis flies the speed asked for, and what isn't asked for brakes away; off: the ship keeps its
// momentum and the thrust only adds to it, the speed easing back to a soft cap). The top speed is the original's
// 2 units/ms (100 m/s, also EVERSPACE 2's); the turn rate scales with the ship's handling, the boost recharge is its
// booster's.
