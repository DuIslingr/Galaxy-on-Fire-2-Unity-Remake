# Campaign (story) flow

How the original drives its story: the single campaign counter in `Status`, the mission object that belongs to each
counter value, who advances it (docking, space levels, cinematics, radio calls), the dialogue tables, the bar,
the restrictions a story mission imposes, and the ending. Covers the main game (indices 0-45), the **Valkyrie**
add-on (46-84) and the **Supernova** add-on (85-162).

All addresses are Ghidra addresses (image base 0x10000) in `libgof2hdaa.so`. Text IDs index `Assets/Localization/text_en.json`.
Station / system / item / ship numbers are the indices of `stations.json`, `systems.json`, `items.json`, `ships.json`.
Tables that live in the binary are decoded by **`Reference/tools/campaign/campaign_flow_tables.py`**:

```
python Reference/tools/campaign/campaign_flow_tables.py            # markdown table, one row per index (generated data)
python Reference/tools/campaign/campaign_flow_tables.py dialog 23  # every page of the briefing + success dialogue of index 23
python Reference/tools/campaign/campaign_flow_tables.py json out.json
```

Per-level details (what spawns in each campaign orbit, `Level::createCampaignMission` 0x0c3370, `LevelScript::process`
0x160d50) are out of scope here; this document only gives each step's goal in one line.

Confidence markers: **(verified)** = read directly from the decompiled code / binary tables; **(inferred)** = deduced
from dialogue text, objective text or surrounding code; **(uncertain)** = plausible but not traced.

## 1. Campaign state in `Status`

### 1.1 The counter

| Field | Meaning | Functions |
|---|---|---|
| `Status+0x1e8` (int) | **campaign index** ("current campaign mission"). One value per story *step*, not per chapter. 0..162. | `getCurrentCampaignMission` 0x0b6840, `setCurrentCampaignMission` 0x0b6c90 (only `GameRecord::load` 0x180dc4, `MenuTouchWindow::startSupernovaChallenge` 0x154238 and the broker special case in `ModStation::OnUpdate` 0x0ed2a8 call the setter) |
| `Status+0x194` | `Array<Mission*>` of length 2 (`getMaxMissions` 0x0b6c80 = 2): **[0] campaign mission, [1] freelance mission** (`Mission::empty` when none) | `getMissions` 0x0b6bf0, `getCampaignMission` 0x0b6846, `setCampaignMission` 0x0b6c0c (sets `Mission+0x50` = campaign flag, deletes the old one), `getFreelanceMission` 0x0b6bf6 / `setFreelanceMission` 0x0b6c00, `removeMission` 0x0b9878 |
| `Status+0x190` (400) | the **active mission of the current level** (the one the orbit is built around, or `Mission::empty`) | `getMission` 0x0b6850, `setMission` 0x0b6826; chosen by `Status::departStation` 0x0b63e0 (§3.2) |
| `Status+0x100/+0x104` | playing time (ms, 64-bit) when the current step started (written by every `nextCampaignMission` case) | used for the 12 s delay of story radio calls (`MGame::OnUpdate` 0x1ac778) |
| `Status+0x178` (bool) | "story radio call pending": set when the index becomes **93, 111 or 143** (`DAT_00252b00` = {0x5d, 0x6f, 0x8f}); `MGame::OnUpdate` plays radio message group 0x1b (0, 1 or 2) in space ≥ 12 000 ms after the step started, then clears it | `nextCampaignMission` loop head |
| `Status+0x1c4` | freelance missions completed (`incMissionCount` 0x0b6c84) | campaign type 0x96 |
| `Status+0x1c0` | kills (`incKills`) | – |
| `Status+0x1d0` | stations visited (`visitStation` 0x0b9918) | index 90 decrements it |
| `Status+0x1ac` | credits (`changeCredits` 0x0b8e84) | rewards |
| `Status+0x38` | `Array<bool>` system visibility (index = system) | several steps reveal systems |
| `Status+0x78` | the **Void space pseudo-station**; `inAlienOrbit` 0x0b6810 = current station == it | Void-space steps |
| `Status+0x7c / +0x80` | Void-invasion **system / station** (−1 none, −10 = disabled for good). Set by steps 24 (9/48), 28 (18/91); between steps 32 and 44 `departStation` moves it to a random visible system every ~10 departures (never systems 10/15, never the campaign target) | `departStation`, step 40 (type 0xa1) |
| `Status+0x84` | station to return to when leaving Void space (0x1a0a = 6666 after the DLC quick-starts) | `MGame::OnUpdate` wormhole code |
| `Status+0x8c` | the player's **own ship** parked while a loaner ship is flown (steps 48-54, 56-57) | cases 0x2f/0x37 save, 0x36/0x39 restore |
| `Status+0x90` | `Array<int>` target stations of a type-0xa3 step (entries become negative when done) | step 59 |
| `Status+0x174` | counter for types 0xa8 / 0xb8 (hacking, passengers) | steps 91, 94, 139 |
| `Status+0x114` | Kaamo (station 108) purchase state (0/1/2/3; 3 when `options[0x36]`); not campaign | `ModStation::OnInitialize` |

### 1.2 Milestone predicates (verified)

- `Status::gameWon` 0x0b6832: **index > 44** (i.e. ≥ 45).
- `Status::dlc1Won` 0x0b8eda: **index > 83** (≥ 84) = Valkyrie finished.
- There is no "dlc2Won"; index 162 is the end of Supernova (objective text 748, last `nextCampaignMission` case 0xa1).
- `GameRecord::load` sets record flags `+0x102 = index > 45` and `+0x119 = index > 85` (save-slot preview badges, inferred).

### 1.3 `Status::nextCampaignMission` 0x0b6c98 (verified)

```
old = Status+0x1e8
loop:
    new = old + 1
    if new in {93, 111, 143}: Status+0x178 = 1
    switch old:
        case 52, 128: old = new; goto loop        # indices 53 and 129 are never current
        case k (known): Status+0x1e8 = new; Status+0x100 = playingTime;
                        side effects; setCampaignMission(new Mission(type, reward, target)); [statusValue / goods / hidden]
        case 45, 106, >=162 (no case): Status+0x1e8 = new; playingTime; campaign mission unchanged
```

So **`case k` creates the objective of index k+1**. The objective of index N is completed → the success dialogue of
index N plays → `nextCampaignMission` → index N+1 with its new objective. The complete transition table is in §4 and
in `T` of the tool script. Mission objects created with the 3-int constructor `Mission::Mission(int type, int reward,
int targetStation)` 0x187cc0 (`Mission+0x50` = 1 → `isCampaignMission`, name "" (`getName` returns text 354+type only
for freelance missions)). Hidden steps call `Mission::setVisible(false)` (not shown on the map / radar / missions list).

### 1.4 New game and DLC starts (verified)

- **`Status::resetGame` 0x0ba78c** (new game, `MenuTouchWindow::startGOF2` 0x1540f0 then module 2 = space, music 143 IntroAtmo):
  index 0, campaign mission `Mission(4, 0, 78)` which is also the active level mission; credits 0; station 78 Var Hastra;
  ship **10 Phantom** with items 2, 2 (Nirai Charged Pulse ×2), 54, 59, 82, 73 and 36 ×6 (Edo). Standing new, Void
  invasion off (−1), all systems at their `initiallyVisible`; if the Valkyrie add-on is owned (`options[0x35]`), system 25 visible.
  Index 0 is the **prologue level** ("3598 A.D. – Dareius Asteroid Belt", texts 1668-1676, briefing = steering/lock tutorial 1677/1680).
- The Phantom is only the prologue ship: at **index 1** `ModStation::OnInitialize` 0x0e8080 replaces it with ship **0 Betty**
  (race 8) carrying **90 Gunant's Drill** and **81 Telta Quickscan**, both unsaleable. The remake's "new game = Phantom
  at Var Hastra" is correct for `resetGame` but the story itself continues in Betty.
- Skipping the prologue cinematic (`MGame::OnTouchEnd` 0x1a98d8, index 0) = `nextCampaignMission`, `setKills(3)`, module 2
  (the index-1 space cinematic); skipping at index 1 goes straight to the station (module 5).
- **`MenuTouchWindow::startValkyrie` 0x153ba4**: `resetGame`, 45× `nextCampaignMission` (→ 45), active mission empty,
  ship **5 Inflict** (Terran) with 2, 5 (items +8/+0x14), 36 ×10, 81, 51, 86 ×10, 85 Khador Drive; station **91 Dima**;
  systems 6 and 25 visible; kills 197; many hints pre-set; then station module.
- **`MenuTouchWindow::startSupernova` 0x153e14**: `resetGame`, 84× `nextCampaignMission` (→ 84), ship **30 Berger CrossXT**
  (Midorian) fully equipped (items 176, 20, 36 ×20, 44 ×20, 81, 51, 68, 86, 85, 56) + 8 Energy Cells; station **70 Dis**;
  kills 386; then station module.
- `MenuTouchWindow::startSupernovaChallenge` 0x154238 sets index **152** directly (ship 46 Blue Fyre) – an arcade mode, not the story.
- Autosave on docking (`ModStation::autosave` 0x0e9eb4 from `OnInitialize`), except index 77 at station 101.

### 1.5 Save-load repairs (`GameRecord::load` 0x180dc4, verified)

Saves are made docked, so the loader moves you back to a safe start when a save was taken inside an in-space chain:
index 25 → 24 (`Mission(4,0,48)`, invasion 9/48), 29 → 28 (`Mission(4,0,91)`, invasion 18/91), 41 → 39
(`Mission(0xb,0,30)`), index 35 with a target ≠ 29 → `Mission(0xb,0,29)`. Supernova-era fixes for old saves force
86..103 back to 86 (`Mission(0xb,0,100)`). After load: `dlc1Won` → the jump drive becomes saleable; `gameWon` → cargo
131 Alien Remains saleable. These tell the remake which steps are **checkpoints**.

## 2. Mission object and objective types

### 2.1 `Mission` fields (game/Mission.c, verified)

| Offset | Field | Accessor |
|---|---|---|
| +0x0 / +0x1 | failed / won flags | `setFailed`/`hasFailed` 0x187fd4, `setWon`/`hasWon` 0x187fdc |
| +0x4 | agent (bar character who gave it; campaign: 0) | `getAgent` 0x1881c0 |
| +0x8 | **type** (−1 = empty) | `getType` 0x187ffa, `isEmpty` 0x187fba |
| +0xc | client name | `getClientName` 0x188058 |
| +0x14 | target name (wanted/escort) | `getTargetName` 0x1881c8 |
| +0x1c | client image | `getClientImage` 0x188066 |
| +0x20 | client race (standing reward) | `getClientRace` 0x18806a |
| +0x24 | **reward** (credits) | `getReward` 0x18806e (`getCosts` also returns +0x24 – bug in the original) |
| +0x2c | bonus | `getBonus` 0x18807e |
| +0x30 / +0x34 | **target station** index / name | `getTargetStation` 0x1880a0, `setTargetStation` 0x1880c8 |
| +0x3c | target system name | `getTargetSystemName` 0x1880b2 |
| +0x44 | difficulty | `getDifficulty` 0x188138 |
| +0x48 | instant-action flag | `isInstantActionMission` 0x18808c |
| +0x4c | distance (jumps) | `calcDistance` 0x188140 |
| +0x50 | **campaign flag** | `isCampaignMission` 0x188092 |
| +0x54 / +0x58 | **production goods** index / amount (goods to deliver, passengers, target amount) | `setProductionGoods` 0x187fe4 |
| +0x5c | **statusValue** (counter / parameter) | `setStatusValue` 0x187ff2 |
| +0x60 | visible | `isVisible` 0x187fce |

`Mission::isOutsideMission` 0x188054 always returns 1 (unused distinction).

### 2.2 Objective types and their completion rule

Rules from **`Status::missionCompleted(bool docked, bool inLoungeIntroDone, long long levelTimeMs)` 0x0b924c** (verified).
It scans both slots ([0] campaign first, then freelance) and returns the first mission whose rule holds; if a mission is
already `hasWon`, it returns null (the dialogue for it is already up). Called with `docked = true` by
`ModStation::OnUpdate` 0x0ed2a8 every frame while no window is open (lounge flag = `SpaceLounge::introFinished`), and with
`docked = false` by `MGame::successCheck` 0x1b0620 in space (every frame after the first 5000 ms of the level).

| Type | Rule (done when …) | Used by indices |
|---|---|---|
| 0x04 | never here: **scripted campaign level** in the target orbit; the level's success objective / `LevelScript` decides | 0, 7, 14, 16, 21, 24, 26, 28, 29, 38, 41, 56, 63, 64, 67, 78, 81, 87, 89, 97, 100, 105, 106, 114, 120, 123, 125, 131, 137, 142, 145, 147, 154, 157, 158 |
| 0x01, 0x06, 0x0a, 0x0c | never here: freelance level types reused (Defense 355, Wanted 360, Intercept 364, Challenge 366 = kill race vs a rival) | 80; 69, 70; 73; 36 |
| 0x0b (and 0) | **docked at the target station** | 1, 3, 5, 8-12, 15, 17, 22, 23, 27, 31, 32, 34, 35, 39, 43, 44, 47, 48, 54, 55, 57, 60, 62, 65, 66, 71, 74-77, 82, 83, 86, 88, 90, 93, 96, 98, 101, 103, 108, 117, 122, 124, 127, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 141, 146, 153, 156, 159 |
| 0x08 | docked at target **with goods(index, amount) in cargo** (index 143: also any pending product 210 at the target) | 33, 68, 118, 121, 143 |
| 0x96 | freelance missions completed ≥ statusValue (step 13: current count + 1) | 13 |
| 0x9a | current cargo load ≥ statusValue t | 2 (10 t), 4 (25 t) |
| 0x9c | in space, in the target orbit, level time ≥ 10 000 ms | 18, 19, 25, 30, 49, 50, 51 |
| 0x9e | a primary weapon (item type 0) and an item of sort 10 mounted (hint 1746: weapon + shield) | 6 |
| 0xa0 | docked anywhere, or in space ≥ 10 000 ms outside the target orbit (target −1 → anywhere): a **delayed story call** | 37, 42, 52 |
| 0xa1 | never here; `departStation` makes it the level mission in the Void-invasion orbit (`Status+0x80`) | 40 |
| 0xa3 | every entry of `Status+0x90` negative | 59 |
| 0xa4 | in space > 10 000 ms (a radio call shortly after launch) | 61, 72, 85, 155 |
| 0xa5 | in space in the target orbit (target −1: level-driven only) | 79, 152 |
| 0xa6 | docked at target with goods in cargo, or the goods item mounted | 58 (179 Liberator ×10), 104 (206 Gamma Shield II) |
| 0xa8 | `Status+0x174` ≥ statusValue (counter reset) | 139 (10) |
| 0xaa | statusValue == 1 (set by the level / cinematic script) | 95, 99, 109, 119, 126, 133, 144, 160, 161 |
| 0xab | docked at target, **inside its Space Lounge**, lounge intro finished | 110, 111, 113, 115, 116, 148-151 |
| 0xac | as 0xab with goods in cargo | 112 (146 Magnetar Juice) |
| 0xae | statusValue ≥ goods amount (e.g. mined tons) | 135 (155 Titanium ×140) |
| 0xb8 | statusValue == 0 (people still to move, decremented by the level); index 92 additionally needs the transporter docking point | 91, 92, 94, 102 |
| 0xbd | docked, an equipment item of sort == statusValue mounted | 20 (sort 6 = EMP bomb) |
| −1 (empty) | never | 45, 84, 128, 130, 162 (free play / wanted hunts) |

Types 0x97 (kills), 0x98 (item mounted), 0x99 (stations visited), 0x9b (`Status+0x1d4`), 0x9d, 0xa2 (blueprint
ingredients), 0xa7, 0xa9, 0xad, 0xb7 exist in `missionCompleted` / other code but no story step uses them (verified
against the transition table). Freelance types 0..15 are named by texts 354..369.

---

## 3. Who advances the story

### 3.1 Docked (`ModStation`, verified)

1. **Docking** (`MGame::dockEvent` 0x1afebc → module 5) runs `ModStation::OnInitialize` 0x0e8080: step-specific stock
   fixes (below), autosave, then `ModStation::OnUpdate` 0x0ed2a8 calls `Status::missionCompleted(true, lounge…)`.
2. If it returns a mission → `DialogueWindow(mission, 0, mode 1)` (success). Campaign content = success pages of the
   current index (§5). A freelance success adds text 389 "Return to #S…" style lines instead.
3. Closing the dialogue (`ModStation::OnTouchEnd` 0x0ea4ec):
   - freelance: `incMissionCount`, reward message, credits, remove;
   - campaign **index 43**: starts the **ending** (§9), no increment yet;
   - campaign **index 148** (broker hunt): no increment (see special case below);
   - otherwise **`nextCampaignMission`**, then by the *new* index N:
     - N ∈ {48, 49, 55, 56, 58}: the hangar cutscene swaps the ship model (loaner / own ship);
     - N ∈ {9, 44, 75, 76, 83}: mission removed, **station module reloaded** (a fresh station scene; the next
       dialogue follows immediately because the new objective is "docked here");
     - N = 45: mission removed, back to free play (a module call through the vtable, uncertain what it shows);
     - N = 18: mission removed, nothing else;
     - N = 77 at station 100: ship 37 Cronus added to the dealer (price 0 via `OnInitialize`);
     - N = 78: `departStation` + space module (**auto-launch**, escape from Valkyrie);
     - N = 84 at station 100: ships 38 Typhon and 40 Nemesis to the dealer, +1 137 S'kloptorr Rum cargo;
     - N = 104: hangar window rebuilt (blueprints);
     - **auto-launch into a story orbit** (`initStreamOutPosition = 1`, `departStation(target)`, module 2): N = 89 → 109,
       99 → 10, 109 → 114, 119 → 10, 133 → 120; N = 144 → 112 and N = 160 → 10 (without stream-out);
     - N = 128: `Status::activateNewWanted` (the Pal Tyyrt hunt uses the wanted boards);
     - then the **reward** (`Mission::getReward + getBonus` of the completed mission) is credited, except for the
       reload / launch branches (their missions all have reward 0 anyway).
4. **Lounge-only objectives** (0xab/0xac) complete when the lounge intro has finished.
5. **Special lounge logic** in `ModStation::OnUpdate`:
   - index **116** in system 18 (Pescal Inartu): each lounge of stations 90-94 not yet searched sets bit (station−90) in
     the statusValue and plays a flavour line (sound 0x619+i, text 2716+i, station 94 uses slot 3) – Maissa (93) is the
     real target (type 0xab);
   - indices **148-150**: in the lounges of 55 Kappa, 66 Inari Onu, 9 Coppolite a one-off broker dialogue (index 148/149/150
     content, bits 1/2/4 of the statusValue, dummy `Mission(0xa0,0,-1)`); at **96 Kalun Amir** the objective completes,
     the code sets the index to **151** and plays dialogue 151; closing it advances to 152. Indices 149/150 are only
     dialogue slots, never current.
6. Step-specific station tweaks in `OnInitialize`: index 20 at Kappa: item 41 EMP GL I free + 10 added to stock; index 27
   at the target: 131 Alien Remains removed from cargo; index 77 at 100: Cronus price 0; indices 80-84 (or `dlc1Won`) at
   100: dealer offers 37/38/40; `gameWon` at Thynome without any Khador Drive: 50 Void Crystals stocked; stations 10/100/101:
   ≥ 10 Energy Cells in stock if the player has < 6; index 162: hint 613 once; `gameWon` / `dlc1Won`: add-on hints 110/111
   if not owned.

### 3.2 In space (`MGame`, `Level`, `LevelScript`)

- **Active level mission** (`Status::departStation` 0x0b63e0, verified): on every launch `Status+400` = the first slot
  whose target is the departing station and whose type is not a "docked/counter" type (excluded: 0x96, 0x97, 0x99,
  0x9b, 0xa1, 0xa2, 0xa3, 0xa4, 0xa6, 0xa7, 0xa9, 0xad, 8, 0xe; a freelance 0xb/0xd also excluded); plus: type 0xa1 in the
  Void-invasion orbit (index < 45), type 0xa0 when the orbit is **not** the target, type 0xad with its goods in cargo.
  `Level::init` 0x0bb49c builds **`Level::createCampaignMission`** when that mission is a campaign mission (unless the
  game is won and no add-on is owned), otherwise the normal `Level::createMission` traffic.
- **Briefing**: `MGame::dialogueEvent` 0x1b0498, after the level's start sequence, opens `DialogueWindow(mode 0)` when the
  index has briefing pages (`DialogueWindow::hasBriefingDialogue` 0x194c90) and the mission is visible.
- **Success**: `MGame::successCheck` 0x1b0620: `missionCompleted(false, …)` or the level objective
  (`Level::checkObjective`). Campaign with success pages → `DialogueWindow(mode 1)`; closing it (`MGame::OnTouchEnd`) →
  `nextCampaignMission` + credits. Campaign **index > 45 without success pages** → `nextCampaignMission` immediately
  (objectives removed, level mission emptied).
- **Failure**: `MGame::gameOverCheck` 0x1b0d04: player dead (after the emergency system) or `Level::checkGameOver` →
  `DialogueWindow(mode 2)` = text 392 "Mission failed!" (+ 527 "The freighter has been destroyed." at indices 38, 40, 41)
  + 319 "Game Over"; the game then reloads the last record (`RecordHandler::recordStoreRead`). Three or more failures in
  a row of the same index make enemy guns deal **×0.7** damage (`Globals::lastCampaignMissionFailCount`,
  `Level::assignGuns` 0x0cb638).
- **Wormholes** (`MGame::OnUpdate`, verified): entering a wormhole with a campaign level mission: index < 41 →
  `nextCampaignMission` (index 29 excluded; index 40 only after `LevelScript` event > 3, and the freighter HP is carried
  over in `Level::lastMissionFreighterHitpoints`); index **41 → the player dies** (you must win first); index 42 →
  objectives removed; then the Void-space exit (`Status+0x84` or the Void station).
- **Khador Drive**: at index 78 using the drive (`MGame::UseKhadorDrive` 0x1a9480) charges a jump to Void space and calls
  `nextCampaignMission`.
- **`LevelScript::process` 0x160d50** advances scripted steps itself (cinematics, fly-throughs). Call sites of
  `nextCampaignMission`: 0x1628be (then departs to station 100), 0x16440c (→ space module), 0x166764 (setStation current),
  0x166eae+0x166eb6 (**two** increments, then station 10), 0x16b72c, 0x16b7d0 (→ station 111), 0x16d41e (→ station 98),
  0x16e102 (→ 111), 0x16f2b0 (→ 113). The one at 0x166764 is inside `case 0x90` (index 144 → 145). Mapping the others to
  indices needs the per-level work (uncertain).
- **Cinematic interludes** (`LevelScript::LevelScript` 0x15e650): indices **95, 99, 109, 119, 126, 133, 160, 161** hide and
  protect the player ship, switch the HUD off and use a look-at camera at (−15000, 800, 75000); their type-0xaa objective
  is set by the script so the success dialogue plays over the scene. These are the "scenes without Keith".
- **Story calls in space**: type 0xa4 (10 s after launch), 0xa0 (10 s outside the target orbit), and the add-on entry
  calls (§3.3).

### 3.3 Add-on entry (verified, `MGame::OnUpdate` 0x1ac778)

- **Valkyrie**: owned (`options[0x35]`), `hints[0x26]` unset, in space, not mining/autopilot, no level mission, `gameWon` →
  success dialogue **46** ("Incoming call detected" … meet Corny at Kanado) with a dummy `Mission(0xa0,0,-1)`, then
  **two** `nextCampaignMission` (45 → 46 → 47 = `Mission(0xb,0,74)`).
- **Supernova**: owned (`options[0x37]`), `hints[0x31]` unset, same conditions, `dlc1Won` → dialogue **85**, then 84 → 85 → 86
  (`Mission(0xb,0,100)`).
- Without the add-on, after `gameWon` / `dlc1Won` the station shows hint 110 / 111 (buy the add-on) once.

## 4. Complete step table (indices 0-162)

Columns: **type** (§2.2), **target** station, **obj** = objective text shown in the Missions window
(`DAT_00258f68[index]`, '#' = target station name; 749 = "I'm on my way to #."), **brief / success** = dialogue text ID
ranges (pages; `dialog N` in the tool prints them with speakers), **reward** credited when the success dialogue closes,
**effects** = side effects of the `nextCampaignMission` case that created the step. "orbit" = the step's level is built
in that station's orbit; "dock" = completes on docking. Goal lines are inferred from type + dialogue + objective text.

Counts: **163 index values** (0-162); 161 reachable (53 and 129 are skipped; 46, 85, 149, 150 are transient/dialogue-only).
Dialogue tables cover 0-161 (162 entries). Briefing pages: 60 in total over 19 indices; success pages: 1028.

---

## 5. Dialogue system (`DialogueWindow`, game/DialogueWindow.c, verified)

- Modes (`DialogueWindow+0x3c`): **0 briefing, 1 success, 2 failure**. `set(mission, mode, index)` 0x1949dc (index −1 = current
  campaign index); mode 1 marks the mission won, mode 2 failed.
- Campaign pages: `DialogueWindow::init` 0x194734 precomputes offsets from `DAT_00259ed0` (briefing lengths) and
  `DAT_0025a158` (success lengths); `loadContent` 0x194cd0 reads the pair `(speaker, textId)` at
  `DAT_0025a3e0` / `DAT_0025a5c0` + offset + 2·page. `length()` 0x195ca4 = entries / 2.
- Speaker `s`: portrait `PTR_DAT_002647ec[s]` (ImageFactory character parts), name **text 1597 + s** (0 Keith T. Maxwell,
  1 Brent Snocom, 2 Gunant Breh, 3 Norris Bernard, 4 Mkkt Bkkt, 5 Tommy, 6 Carla, 7 Errkt Uggut, … 15 Computer, 16 Info,
  17 Story, … 26 Alice, 31 Cornelius Tenner, 38 Moonsprocket, 40 Brillo Lampeter, … 70 Battleship). Speaker 0 (Keith) sets
  `+0x68` (player portrait side). Speakers 19 (Void) and 56 use the alien font.
- Per page: voice/sfx `Globals::getDialogueSoundId(textId, agent)`; with voice-over on (`options[0xe]`) pages advance when
  the sound ends. Special pages: 1718/1730 (`0x6b6`/`0x6c2`) get key-binding tokens replaced; 1833 (`0x729`) plays sound
  0x88 + 0xa2; 2785/2786 (`0x891`/`0x892`) are swapped for 2783/2784 when the statusValue is 1; 2782 (`0xade`) in German
  shows the Info portrait.
- Buttons: Back (text 179), Next (180) → on the last page Close (181); Skip (395).
- Failure (campaign): 392 + (527 at indices 38, 40, 41) + 319.
- Freelance success: random text from `DAT_0025c6c4` (5 variants) + "\n\n" + 389 "Return to #S to collect your reward." for a
  story agent, else 216 "Mission accomplished!"; type 12 (challenge) uses 370 with #Q1/#Q2 lap times; station 108 (Kaamo) has its own 6/18-page
  dialogue from `DAT_0025c5f0` / `DAT_0025c680`.

---

## 6. Station bar, agents and the Missions window

- **Campaign steps are never offered by bar agents.** They are automatic: the objective of the current index is
  always in slot [0], and its dialogues open by themselves on docking, in the lounge (0xab/0xac), in space or in cinematics.
- "Story agents" in the code are the **named bar characters** of `agents.json` (`Status::loadAgents`, list at `Status+0x20`, `Status::getAgents` 0x0b9af4):
  `Agent::isStoryAgent` 0x1a6726 = `Agent+0x50 == 0` (agent index ≥ 0), `isGenericAgent` 0x1a6732 = `+0x50 == 1` (index −1,
  random). `Generator::createAgents` 0x0a1fd0 puts every named agent of the station into the lounge when **index > 16**
  (station 106 Sao Perula only after `dlc1Won`), fills up to 3-5 agents with generic ones (`createAgent`), refreshes
  offer 9 (sells an item from `DAT_00251d10`, cheaper set before index 142) and offer 10 (sells a ship from `DAT_00251f40`).
  With a hostile race a spy agent (offer 7) may appear (35 %). At **index 23 at Thynome** an extra generic agent sells item
  **68 AB-1 "Retractor"** (tractor beam) for 100 000 (Info pages 191/192 at the end of success dialogue 23); `ModStation::OnTouchEnd` at index 24
  marks him as gone when you launch.
- A story agent's freelance mission success adds "Return to #S…" (389) with the agent's station.
- Lounge visuals and chat UI: see `station_interior.md`.
- **Menu buttons** (`ModStation::OnInitialize`, verified): 0 Hangar (167), 1 Space Lounge (398), 2 Map (177),
  3 Missions (129), 4 Status (169). Half-transparent (disabled): Hangar while index < 5; Map and Missions while index < 9
  or == 15; Lounge while index < 12, == 15, or at stations 100/101.
- **MissionsWindow** (`MissionsWindow::init` 0x17a604): tabs 129 Missions / 3219 Most Wanted; left pane = campaign: objective text
  `DAT_00258f68[index]` (index < 164) with '#' → target station name (types 0xa7/0xae: '#Q' → amount progress). When
  `gameWon` and no add-on is owned: text 670, or 650 (all gold medals, VoidX at Thynome). Right pane = the freelance
  mission (freelance missions can be cancelled there). The map button in it opens `StarMap(missionMode, mission)`
  (`starmap_travel.md`).
- Stranded check on docking: no jumpgate route, no jump drive, no Khador Drive in cargo, index > 16 → offer a 25 000 shuttle
  to Magnetar (335).

---

## 7. Restrictions during a story step (details in `autopilot_travel.md` / `starmap_travel.md`)

"On a mission" = the **level mission** (`Status+400`) is non-empty and its type ∉ {0, 0xb, 0xd, 0xab, 0xac} (0xbd also
allowed for docking / the drive). Then:

- **Docking** refused with HUD event 0x15 → text **525 "Not possible on a mission."** (`MGame::dockEvent` 0x1afebc);
  also for indices 49-54 unless the station is 74 Kanado.
- **Planet-jump locks** refused with the same event (`Radar::draw` 0x1554fc, `missionBlocks`).
- **Khador Drive** refused with the same event (`MGame::UseKhadorDrive` 0x1a9480), except at index 78 (the drive *is* the
  step: it charges a jump and advances the index); additionally refused at index 65 while in the target (Kothar) orbit.
- **Autopilot button** off at index ≤ 1 and 48; planet locks only after index 1, fire-jump only from index 10; galaxy
  view on the map only after index 15.
- **Star map requirement boxes** when you pick the campaign target (`StarMap::OnTouchEnd` 0x0db69c): 24 scanner +
  tractor beam (532), 91/94 passenger cabins (3214), 105 Gamma Shield II (3217), 135 drill (3213), 139 Vossk ship + signature
  (3215), 142 spectral filter + plasma collector + 15 ionizing missiles (3216) / 1 t free cargo (3218).
- There is **no general jump block** in this binary apart from the above; the "mission blocks (text 525)" in the star-map
  notes is this same event.

**Markers**: the campaign target station gets the gold "story" icon 0x454 next to its planet on the radar
(`Radar::draw`, visible missions only, not during 148-151, special cases 116 (unsearched lounges 90-94), 120 (Maissa),
125 (freighter-route stations)), on the star map (icon slot 1), and the freelance target the white icon 0x455. The
Missions-window map draws a yellow route to the target. Void-invasion station `Status+0x80` is marked after index 32.

## 8. Rewards summary (verified)

Credits come only from `Mission::getReward + getBonus` when a campaign success dialogue closes (station or space), plus
the +40 000 of 44→45: 23 → 20 000, 31 → 30 000, 54 → 200 000, 57 → 150 000, 60 → 50 000 + 50 000·v, 72 → 150 000,
45 → 40 000. Items / ships / blueprints are handed out by the `nextCampaignMission` side effects listed in §4 (loaner ships
48/49/56, Khador Drive blueprint 34, Liberator 58, Disruptor 72, Cronus 77/83, Typhon + Nemesis 84, Gamma Shield I 94,
repair beam 102, Gamma Shield II blueprint 104, Chromo Plasma blueprint 141, plasma kit 142). Standing: a campaign success
dialogue also calls `Standing::applyMissionCompleted(clientRace)` only for freelance missions (campaign missions have no
client race).

---

## 9. Ending, credits and post-game

- **Index 43**, docked at Thynome, success dialogue closes (`ModStation::OnTouchEnd`): mission removed, music **144
  OutroSong**, a `Radio` with messages **2071-2074** ("Keith! You did it! …", 4000 ms delay), image 0x1b5a, a centred
  `ScrollTouchBox` with **text 48 (the staff credits)** scrolling up, `CutScene(2)` started after 6 s (`ModStation::OnUpdate`,
  state `+0x5c`). After **136 000 ms** (`+0xb0` > 0x21340, starting at −12 000) — or a tap once the last radio message is
  shown (`ModStation::OnTouchBegin` 0x0ea154) — `nextCampaignMission` (→ 44) and the station module restarts.
- **Index 44** at Thynome: dialogue 2075-2078 (Carla's note); closing → 45, **+40 000**, `gameWon`.
- Post-game: `Level::init` builds normal traffic missions; MissionsWindow shows 670; station hints 110 (buy Valkyrie);
  with all gold medals Thynome offers ship 8 **VoidX** (text 650); Thynome keeps Void Crystals stocked for the Khador Drive.
- **Valkyrie end**: success 83 at Kothar → station reload → 84 (`dlc1Won`), dealer bonuses; hint 111 (buy Supernova).
  No credits roll.
- **Supernova end**: 159 celebration → 160 (auto-launch cinematic at Thynome, the letter) → 161 (Maissa bar cinematic) →
  162 (end; hint 613). No credits roll. The main-menu credits (`MenuTouchWindow` 0x14816c, text 48) are separate.

---

## 10. Uncertainties

- Exact mapping of the `LevelScript::process` `nextCampaignMission` call sites (except 0x166764 = index 144) to indices;
  which steps (14, 24, 28, 40, 49-52, 69, 78, 79, 81, 87, 89, 91, 100, 105-107, 120, 123, 131, 137, 157) end by script vs
  by `successCheck`'s "no success dialogue → advance" rule.
- Targets −1 (25, 28-29, 40-42, 79, 81, 147, 152, 154) are Void space or the invasion orbit; which one per step needs the
  level code. 81 (chasing Alice) is a guess.
- 0xb8 statusValues 83 (Luur) and 1700 (Tadram) are read as "people to move"; the level may interpret them differently.
- The N = 45 branch in `ModStation::OnTouchEnd` calls a vtable slot (+0x10) with 0x10000 – probably a module/menu reset.
- Sort numbers (6 = EMP bomb, 10 = shield, 18 = jump drive, 19 = mining laser) are inferred from context, not from a table.
- Index 107 has no creating case (current mission stays the 106 one); it is probably advanced by the level script.
- Standing effects of story kills are handled by the levels (not traced).

## 11. Remake implementation notes

Plain C# (namespace `GoF2Remake.Data` / `GoF2Remake.World`), unit-testable, data generated from the tool's `json` output.

    public static bool IsComplete(StoryMission m, StoryContext ctx);   // ctx: docked, inLounge, levelMs, station, cargo, equipment, counters
    public static void Advance(StoryState s, StoryTable t, IStoryWorld w);  // index+1 (skip 53/129), apply OnEnter, new mission
    public static bool IsLevelMission(StoryMission m, int departingStation, StoryState s);  // departStation rule (§3.2)
    public static bool BlocksDockingAndJumps(StoryMission levelMission);  // type ∉ {0, 0xb, 0xd, 0xab, 0xac}
}
```

- Keep the index semantics exactly (objective of N created on entering N; success dialogue N; then N+1), including the
  skipped 53/129, the transient 46/85 and the 148→151 broker shortcut; the dialogue and objective tables are then a
  direct copy of the binary tables.
- A `StoryDirector` MonoBehaviour per scene: in `Station` it runs `IsComplete(docked: true, …)` each frame when no window is
  open, shows the dialogue, then applies the post-close branch (§3.1 step 3); in `Space` it runs the in-space check after
  5 s, the briefing after the start sequence, failure → "Mission failed!" + reload of the autosave (the remake already
  keeps one in memory), and the Valkyrie/Supernova entry calls (§3.3).
- Per-step level content (type 0x04/0x01/0x06/0x0a/0x0c/0xa1/0xa5/0xaa) comes from the separate `createCampaignMission` /
  `LevelScript` research; until then a step can be marked "auto-succeed after N seconds" for testing the flow.
- Wire the restrictions through one query (`BlocksDockingAndJumps`) used by the Dock prompt, planet-jump lock, Khador
  Drive and the star map; the requirement boxes of §7 are a small per-index table.
- Replace the remake's free-play assumptions (`GoF2Session.CampaignMission = 20`, Var Hastra drill/energy cells) once the
  story runs: start at index 0 with the prologue, or at index 1 in Betty if the prologue level is not built yet.
- Save games: persist `Index`, the current mission (type/target/statusValue/goods/visible), invasion station, parked ship,
  target list, counter; on load apply the §1.5 checkpoint repairs.
